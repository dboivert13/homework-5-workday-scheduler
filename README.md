# homework-5-workday-scheduler

In the fifth homework assignment with the Georgia Tech Web Development bootcamp I was tasked with creating a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The requirements and acceptance criteria are as follows:

## User Story

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively


## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

## The Approach: 

This project challenged me to use most of what we have learned so far. Creating the HTML was the first thing I did, and it wasn't until halfway through creating new elements from scratch that I realized that the CSS that was provided had most of the styling I needed to reference. Once I was set on the right path with the HTML, I was able to move to my script file. Using moment JS - I was able to pull in the necessary information to begin the logic portion of the project. The jQuery library really carried me here and my familiarity with the documentation made all the difference.
